# Scrum
Some key players in a Scrum:
- **Development Team**
    - this can include testers
- **Product Owner**
    - individual or group that handles communication for the Stakeholder/s
- **Stakeholder**
    - individual or entity the sprint work is being done for
- **Scrum Master**
    - team member that is leading the Scrum Team
        - can be a technically knowledgeable individual, but does not need to be
        - primarily responsible for handling communication between the Development Team and the Product Owner
        - also responsible for handling cross team communication
- **Team Members**
    - members of the Development Team
    - "Scrumlings"

## Scrum Terms
Any Scrum project has 3 main phases:
1. **Initial Phase**
    - Initial project planning is started
        - Initial documentation on work that needs to be completed
        - initial story pointing and velocity targets determined
        - team members will be assigned initial Epics/User Stories to work on 
        - Scrum Master will coordinate with Product Owner to verify that the Scrum team and the Stakeholders are on the same page about work that needs to be done
        - Initial Project Backlog is created
2. **Sprint Cycles**
    - Easily the longest phase of a Scrum
    - As long as there are Sprints for work, you are in the Sprint Cycles phase
    - the length of the phase will fluctuate based upon conversations between the Scrum Master and Product Owner
    - Work is moved from the Project Backlog into the Sprint Backlog each Sprint iteration
3. **Closure Phase**
    - documentation is finalized
    - product is officially handed off to the Stakeholder

### Scrum Terms: Backlog
All work in a Scrum should in some way shape or form be organized in at least one of two "Backlogs" for the project:
- **Sprint Backlog**
    - any work that is currently being done should be organized/stored in the Sprint Backlog
- **Project Backlog**
    - all work not currently being worked on is stored in the Project Backlog
        - as you move through your Sprints work is moved from the Project Backlog into the Sprint Backlog

### Scrum Terms: Ceremonies
Scrum Ceremonies are standardized activities to facilitate the process of working Sprint to Sprint:
- **User Story Planning**
    - At the start of a Sprint (or in the intital phase) you create and organize the User Stories that need to be worked on
        - this can include designing the Epics that will be used to organize the User Stories, or you can use pre-provided User Stories
        - Story Points need to be assigned, team members need to be assigned, priority can also be assigned
- **Daily Scrum** (Daily Standup)
    - Daily check in where everyone on the team gets on the same page
        - discuss the following:
            - What are you working on?
            - What blockers do you have
                - spend some time assisting those that have blockers
            - receive new assignment if your work is done
    - This meeting is supposed to be quick: it should be a time to get everyone on the same page and provide quick assistance for those that need some help
- **Sprint Retrospective** (Sprint Review)
    - When a Sprint cycle is finished you want to take some time to review your work:
        - what went well
        - what can be improved upon
        - review any remaining work to determine whether to move back to the Project Backlog or leave it in the Sprint Backlog
