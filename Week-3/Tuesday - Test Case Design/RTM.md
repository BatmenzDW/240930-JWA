# Requirements Traceability Matrix
A Requirements Traceability Matrix is a document designed to provide a visual relationship between an application's requirements and its features (the things you can do with it, login, register, transfer money, etc). The scope of an RTM can be large or small, but all RTMS should in some way help with tracking work on an application

Something to keep in mind about RTMS is they are "living" documents: they are meant to help with tracking work on an application, and as the scope and requirements for working on said application changes the RTM should adjust to accommodate those changes

# Acceptance Criteria
A common feature of a RTM is "Acceptance Criteria". AC is one or more steps/actions that must be accomplished in order to achieve or complete a feature/use case of an application.
