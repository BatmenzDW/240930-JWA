# Use Case
At their core, Use Cases are actions that users of an application should be able to take. Consider Wikipedia: users can upload articles, search for articles, and choose a language of their preference. These actions can all be construed as Use Cases. 

Use Cases are a helpful way of organizing requirements and features of an application that need to be tested. The criteria to "successfully" complete a Use Case are typically going to be augmented by other requirements.

One of the reasons Use Cases are useful is because they can accommodate multiple "scenarios" of use. Going back to Wikipedia: when searching for an article there are multiple possible outcomes: if looking up something popular, like puppies or a famous artist, you should expect to be able to find an appropriate article on the subject. However, if you look up instructions on a topic that is illegal, you should not expect to be able to find an associated article. These scenarios would all appropriately be classified as part of the same Use Case: looking up information on Wikipedia
