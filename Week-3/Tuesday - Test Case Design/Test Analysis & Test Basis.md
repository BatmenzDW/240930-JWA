# Test Analysis & Test Basis
Before any testing can begin the testing needs to analyze the requirements they are working with. However, part of knowing what your application requirements are involves knowing where the requirements can be found and how they are related to each other

Once you have analyzed the resources available to you, you need to determine what is actually testable among those resources: the testable content you discover/determine constitutes your "Test Basis". These are the features, configurations, resources, anything related to the application that requires testing. 

In short, you perform test analysis to determine your test basis. Analysis is used to figure out requirements and logically group them, which leads to a natural grouping of application features, capabilities, and resources, that become your test basis.

Keep in mind this is a fluid process: the typical pattern is analysis helps you to determine basis, but as you determine your test basis you can go back over your requirements and analyze them again to help you better understand both what is being tested and how it needs to be tested
