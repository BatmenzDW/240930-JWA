# Positive Testing
Anytime you are validating that a usecase and/or feature works correctly when a user provides "valid" information (data that conforms to any and all requirements) you are doing Positive Testing.

# Negative Testing
Anytime you are validating that a usecase and/or feature works correctly when a user provides "invalid" information (data that does not conform to any and all requirements) you are doing Negative Testing

# Dynamic Testing
Both Positive and Negative testing are a form of "Dynamic Testing". This kind of test involves the active running and engagement of software

# Static Testing
If your test does not involve running software you are doing "Static Testing". This typically involves the verification of documentation and requirements via review of those documents and/or conversation with product stakeholders
