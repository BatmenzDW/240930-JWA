# Severity vs Priority
- Severity
    - How much of an effect does the discovered defect have on the capabilities of the tested application
        - low severity: competitor logo on a company homepage
        - high severity: feature for updating user profile is completely bricked
- Priority
    - How quickly should a defect be addressed
        - this one is tougher to gauge: depending on the actual defect discovered you will have to make a judgment call on how quickly the developers should move to fix the defect
            - if you are small company and you accidentally put the wrong logo, that may not be much of a problem
            - if you are a mega corporation and you have a competitor's logo instead of your own, you are giving them free advertisement which can lead your potential customers away from your service to your competitors, meaning lost revenue. In this case, you could argue that the wrong logo is a high priority fix even though the severity of the defect is low
