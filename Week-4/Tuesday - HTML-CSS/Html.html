    <!-- 
        Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) is the backbone of the web: if you have visited a web
        page you have made use of HTML.

        The basic building blocks of an HTML file are the "tags" used to create the "elements"
        of the web page. Elements are read/rendered from the top of the page down, each line of
        HTML being read from left to right
    -->
    
    <!-- 
        A common way text is presented on a web page is through the use of a paragraph element.
        These elements are used to easily provide styling and structure to the text of your
        web page. This element is a "block" element, so the browser will render it on its own
        row of the web page 
    -->
    this text exists directly in the body
    <p>This is a common way of presenting text on a web page</p>
    <p>Since paragraphs are block elements, they will render on different rows</p>

    <!-- 
        Another style of element is "inline" elements: this content is rendered on the same 
        row as other inline elements. One type of inline element is the "input" element: this
        is used to take in user data of various kinds

        Note how the tag (singular) for these inputs also include a type="something" section:
        the word "type" is an attribute of the element, and the text in quotes is the value of 
        that attribute. Through the use of attributes you can further customize how your elements
        behave on the web page
    -->
    <input type="text"> <!-- this tells the browser the input is for generic text -->
    <input type="password"> <!-- this tells the browser the input is for passwords, so the characters should be obfuscated -->

    <!-- 
        Typically an input element would have some associated label element. When you have this
        setup you will typically see the label and input wrapped inside of a "form" element. Forms
        used to be the primary way of making http requests, but with the advent of JavaScript they
        are now used more for their ability to control user input than their ability to make HTTP
        requests
    -->

    <form action="http://localhost:8080/something" method="get">
        <label for="inputThree">inputThree label</label>
        <input type="password" name="exampleInput" id="inputThree">
        <button>my button</button>
    </form>

    <!--  
        A common web element for organizing data on a page is the "table" element. These elements
        contain two sub sections: a "header" section and a "body" section. All together, these
        elements let you create table like structures in your web pages
    -->

    <!-- The table element is used to organize all the contents of your table -->
    <table>
        <!-- 
            The two elements below, thead and tbody, are examples of "semantic" elements: they
            differ in their intended use cases, but those intended uses are "semantic": we could
            switch them and our table would still be able to render, but it would potentially
            cause problems for tools such as screen readers, and it would be an unusual usage
            of the elements if the thead contained the body of the table and the tbody contained the
            headers of the table. 

            Keep this in mind anytime you have an element that is acting as a container for other 
            elements on the page: your "semantic" elements are providing context for the intended
            use case of the elements stored within
        -->

        <!-- thead is where the header elements of your table should go -->
        <thead>
            <!-- 
                "tr" is used to create a row in a table: you would have a unique row element
                to represent each unique record you want stored in your table element 
            -->
            <tr>
                <!-- "th" is used to create a header cell in a table -->
                <th>This is my first header</th>
                <th>This is my second header</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <!-- tbody is where the table content should go -->
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <!-- "td" is used to create a table data cell -->
                <td>this is my first piece of data</td>
                <td>this is my second piece of data</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <!-- you can put your elements on the same line of HTML text: it does not change the rendering -->
                <td>this is data</td><td>for a second record</td><td>We can add an extra cell if we want</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <!-- 
        HTML has two primary ways of listing data on your page, similar to making a bullet point
        list or numbered list: the "ordered list" and the "unordered list". Both those elements
        use the "list item" element to organize the data of the list
    -->

    <!-- an unordered list creates a bullet point list of the stored elements -->
    <ul>
        <li>Apple</li>
        <li>Orange</li>
        <li>Strawberry</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- an ordered list will provide a numeric value for each element -->
    <ol>
        <li>open login page</li>
        <li>enter username and password</li>
        <li>log in to the service</li>

    <!-- 
        The "button" element is typically used when a user wants to perform some action on
        the webpage. This can trigger an http request, a transformation on the page, etc.

        Buttons will typically have an id attribute so they can be assigned some action via
        JavaScript, but the action can also be defined directly in the button tag via the 
        "onclick" attribute
    -->

    <button onclick="alert('this is your alert!')">click me to create an alert!</button>

    <!-- 
        If you want to embed an image in your web page you use the "img" element. This can be
        a local image or one found on the web

    <!-- if the src attribute is set correctly, your image will be rendered in the browser -->
    <img src="../../Week-3/Tuesday - Test Case Design/testing-pyramid.png" alt="testing pyramid">

        Select elements are used when you want to provide a curated list of options to your
        users. Often this element can be used to allow a user to select from a pre-defined list
        of available options: think things like choosing a drink size, saved payment options,
        shirt size, quantity of objects to purchase, etc.
