## Instructions
Your job as a testing team is to look for defects in the demo Library application prototype. Anything you think does not meet the requirements listed above should be included in your report
### Document your Verification work
- include any defects you discover in the source code
    - include recommended fixes

### Document your Validation work
- use Postman or Thunderclient to make retesting easy

## Stretch Goal
Once you have documented your findings take time to implement your suggested fixes, and add the results of your fixes to your documentation
