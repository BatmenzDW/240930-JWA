# Bike Testing Scenario

## Objective
The goal of this activity is to work through the initial phases of the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) by simulating the following steps:
- Requirement Analysis
- Test Planning
- Test Case Development

You will be working through the first three phases of the STLC for a theoretical company that wants you to organize and design the initial testing for a new bike. You will be provided the requirements for the bike: it is your job to organize the testing documentation for the bike and its requirements for the bike company

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements:
- **Gear Switching Supported**
- **Front and Rear Wheel Braking Supported**
    - Can be done separately or together
- **Adjustable Seat Height**
    - Height range: 0 - 12 inches
- **Adjustable Handle Bar Width**
    - Width range: 0 - 6 inches
- **Functional Bell**
    - Loudness level: 70-80 dB
- **Can Function in Smooth and Extreme Riding Conditions**

### Non-Functional Requirements:
- **All-Terrain Wheels Should Be Installed**
- **The Seat Should Be an Ergonomic Design**
- **6 Gear Settings Should Be Present**
- **The Bike Frame Should Be Made of Titanium**

## Order of Operations

### Requirements Analysis
1. Perform test analysis on the test basis documentation (requirements documentation and instructions) to determine test conditions.
2. Create acceptance criteria based on the test conditions.
3. Organize the acceptance criteria in a Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) with the following information:
    - Requirement
    - Description
    - Acceptance Criteria
    - Priority
    - Associated Test Cases

### Test Planning
1. Create a Test Plan with the following information:
    - Test Strategy
    - Effort Estimates
    - Cost Estimates
    - Test Environment
    - Test Limitations

### Test Case Development
1. Use the strategies determined in the previous phase to determine and organize your test data.
2. Create test cases based on your test data and strategies utilized.
    - Include negative tests where applicable.
3. Organize your test cases in test suites.
4. Update your RTM so the acceptance criteria is linked with associated test cases.

## Final Test Artifacts
Your final test artifacts should include the following:
- Requirements Traceability Matrix
- Test Plan
- Test Cases organized in Test Suites

### Final Note
- Take time to create and organize your documentation
    - don't just write things in a txt file: use tools like Word, Excel, or VSC with stylized Markdown
- Remember that testing documents are living documents: as you progress through the initial STLC phases make sure you go back to previously created documentation and update it with any new information
