# Object Oriented Programming
- Abstraction
  - you don't need to know how it works to use it
- Polymorphism
  - resources can take on many shapes
- Inheritance
  - parent resources can provide child resources with their properties
- Encapsulation
  - related resources are enclosed together and access is controlled this way
