# Test Suite Creation Order of Operations
1. Create Feature Files
2. Generate Steps
    - I recommend do this feature file by feature file to help with organization
3. Create Page Object Models
4. Create Test Runner
   - if you have done all the other steps you should know what resources you need to initialize in your runner to perform your testing
5. Implement the generated steps from step 2
