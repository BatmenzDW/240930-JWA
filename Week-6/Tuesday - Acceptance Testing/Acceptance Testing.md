# Acceptance Testing
- Top of the testing pyramid
    - least number of tests compared to other layers of your testing

## Types of Acceptance Testing
- User Acceptance Testing
    - Does the application meet the requirements of the end user
    - Typically this work has to be done manually due to the subjective nature of User Acceptance testing criteria, but with the advent of generative AI the potential to create automated systems to perform User Acceptance Testing for you is now a possibility
- Operational Acceptance Testing
    - Does the application meet the administrative requirements of the system
        - less performance and more auxiliary concerned
            - is data backed up correctly?
            - are logs generated correctly?
            - if there are an installer/un-installer, do they function correctly?
            - are security vulnerabilities handled?
            - etc.
- Contractual Acceptance Testing (Regulatory Acceptance Testing)
    - does the application meet contractual/regulatory requirements?
        - Often done in association with an authority figure in person reviewing your application, logs, resources, etc.
- Alpha/Beta Testing
    - Alpha testing is the process of having internal team members use an application to see if it works as intended
    - Beta testing is having people outside of the internal team test the application to see if it works as intended
